<p align="center"> A CMS for yoga and fitness studios written in Django. </p>

The aim of this project is to create a CMS for managing subscriptions, single visits and purchases for gyms, yoga studios. This project is a result of frustration with available expensive CMS services, while open source variants seem to be very complex with functionality that I did not need anyways. It is largely a learn-as-you go along process, given that this is my fist Django App. But this software is already being actively used as the main accounting tool at one studio in Russia, [Formula Yoga](https://www.formulayoga.com/).   

It seeks to have minimal dependencies and preferably based on Django, specifically around its already integrated admin interface, for easy deployment. Some front-end elements could eventually be written in Vue.js.

## Backend

Uses Django and its admin interface for now.

- Installation [instructions can be found here](backend/).

## Frontend

*in development*

Uses Vue.js 3, currently experimental as the community is transitioning from the 2nd version to the new one.

- Installation [instructions can be found here](frontend/).
